# ESP32_LED Documentation

## Project Description
The project involves using an ESP32, a mini development board, to control a little LED using Alexa. The motivation behind the project is to get the user introduced to the idea of Do-It-Yourself Internet of Things (DIY IoT), wherein we use off-the-shelf components and open source tools to build devices that connect to the internet, enabling a remote access and a transfer of data or commands, among other things. All the resources used are tagged in-text and mapped to the respective sources in the reference section in order.

## Milestones
1. Set up the software: install the Arduino IDE, the necessary packages, and set up the code.
2. Set up the hardware: connect the ESP and the LED to the breadboard and the entire setup to the laptop for powersource.
3. Testing the prototype: use Alexa to turn on or off the LED.
4. Further tweaks: edit the code to play around with the LED further.

## Materials Used
1. ESP32: An IoT mini development board with a 32bit RISC-V singlecore processor operational upto 160 MHz.
2. Blue LED
3. Solderless Breadboard: Used to temporarily connect the ESP to the LED.
4. USB A-C: Used to connect the ESP32 to the laptop and transfer the code to the ESP. It is also used to allow for the laptop to act as a powersource for the circuit.
5. Laptop with Arduino IDE installed: I used an ASUS VivoBook Laptop with AMD Ryzen 7 4700U processor, 8.0 GiB RAM, 1.0 TB SSD storage, and Arch Linux-based EndeavourOS
