## Log file containing timestamp of the process

1. 5:30 PM: Started with the project and the documentation.

2. 5:36 PM: I am downloading the Arduino IDE software. Going through the documentation shared by the makerspace team: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ILUwVJau7dqHt7u987nV3i2fWaezmoz3xmDAD6VhAEY/edit?tab=t.0

3. 5:45 PM: I have read the entire documentation. I am now downloading the requirements. As the software (the IDE) is downloading, am going through this: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/

4. 5:48 PM: I have installed the software and plugged the ESP to the laptop. Opened the IDE

5. 5:52 PM: The packages in the IDE are getting installed, and so i am learning about breadboards: https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/breadboard/

6. 6:09 PM: I am trying to properly set up the software. The wifi is giving me issues. Meanwhile, I am documenting stuff. The IDE is installed but the packages are getting installed. I learned about the breadboard and visualized how the circuit will look like. After the packages are installed, I will follow the steps in the given doc and complete setting up the software before moving forward with the hardware set up. I had the ESP32 plugged into the laptop, which I later realized was not needed since the IDE was not ready. All it did was heat up the little ESP.

7. 6:22 PM: The packages are still not installed. The wifi keeps getting disconnected, and I end up having to restart everything. Anyway, meanwhile, I have set up the breadboard as described in the documentation.

8. 6:35 PM: The packages are installed finally. I am putting up the code, making edits. Connected the ESP to the laptop. Will push the code.

9. 6:51 PM: Done, the led's on! :) Now i will try to figure out brightness control.

10. 7:01 PM: The Alexa has stopped recognizing my device for some reason. I changed names and tried but still it's not working.

11. 7:09 PM: I am currently stuck on this. I tweaked everything, rebooted my laptop, tried re-setting up the breadboard, tried multiple names, etc. but Alexa is still not picking up the device. I am not getting any errors either. Everything seems to be working as it's supposed to. I am stuck.

12. 7:30 PM: Ok, so in one another attempt of calling a new name, it asked if I meant the name I had originally given my device. So, basically, when it stopped recognizing initially, it just didn't hear the name properly, and I did not need to change the name. Either way, I am not sure why changing names did not change the name for Alexa despite re-discovering devices multiple times.

13. 7:35 PM: I am now trying to mess around with the brightness. While the Alexa is taking my command, and the Serial Monitor shows updates to the brightness value, I don't think the LED is changing its brightness.

14. 7:45 PM: I made some tweaks, but still nothing is changing. I have to leave now though, so I am done for now.
