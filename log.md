   started with the project
2. 5:36 PM
   I am downloading the Arduino IDE software. Going through the documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ILUwVJau7dqHt7u987nV3i2fWaezmoz3xmDAD6VhAEY/edit?tab=t.0
3. 5:45 PM
   as the software is downloading, am going through this: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/
4. 5:48 PM
   I have installed the software and plugged the ESP to the laptop. Opened the IDE
5. 5:52 PM
   the packages in the IDE are getting installed, and so i am learning about breadboards in parallel: https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/breadboard/
6. 6:09 PM
   i am just setting up the software right and documenting stuff. the IDE is installed but the packages are getting installed. I learned about the breadboard and visualized how the circuit will look like. After the packages are installed, I will follow the steps in the given doc and complete setting up the software before moving forward with the hardware set up.

   the package installation is causing issues since the wifi is shitty 
   so i have set up the breadboard as described in the documentation

   now i will try to figure out brightness control
